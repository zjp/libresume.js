# I'm already sick of writing tailored resumes by hand. 

Let's count the terrible ways to manage a resume ordered from least to most tedious:

1. Just make a CV and comment out what you don't need for a particular position
2. Maintain N copies of your resume for the N types of job you are interested in
3. Maintain 1 copy of your resume and add/delete content as necessary (but seriously if this is you just do 1)

## There has to be a better way

I want to select a job title from a dropdown list and download a PDF with the relevant data already on it.

Failing that, I at least want to be able to check off things I want to include on _a_ resume from my full CV. 

Let's make that happen.

## Didn't JSONResume already do this?
Yeah, so what?
